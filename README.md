#This assignment was challenging. I was unable to generate a password to the page.
#My application did include user prompts, conditionals, and array's. I also created my own functions; userPrompt() to take in user validated data and shuuffle() to shuffle the array characters while also implementing Math.floor and Math.random.
#In the generatePassword() function I tried to contain the user data with if statments and an empty array to load the user data. However I was unable to generate the results on the page. *I would love feedback on what went wrong*
